# MatricesBASIC
Math matrices (matrix) subs written in BASIC computer language

This is a work in progress.

Matrices.bas is a set of subs in BASIC to allow other programmers to use for matrices manipulation how they seem fit.

I chose to use the array like a sheet of paper. That is allocate space to work on. The reason for this is that there are many limitations to the BASIC language. So to this techinque will allow for operations like transpose and to copy a matrix from one array to another. We can have matrices of different shapes just as long as they do not exceed the limits of the array. So the array needs to be defined large enough.

Of course, this might seem like waisted space and bad programming practices. Yet the operations seem to require such resource use and with today's computers we have the resouces to use.

Please feel free to use and explore at your own risk.
